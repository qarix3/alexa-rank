$$
L = \text{average number in the system} \\

W_q = \text{average waiting time in the queue} \\
P_0 = \text{ideal} \\

\lambda W \text{and}L_q = \lambda W_q 


mean arrival rate, \lambda = 10\text{customer/hour}\\

mean service rate, \mu = \\

P_0 = 1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \\


\lambda = 4/min \\
\mu = 5/min \\

p = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}

 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 \\

 W_q = \frac{\lambda}{\mu\left(\mu - \lambda \right)}
