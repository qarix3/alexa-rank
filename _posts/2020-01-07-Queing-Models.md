$$
L = \text{average number in the system} \\
L_q= \text{average number in the queue} \\
W = \text{average waiting time in the system} \\
W_q = \text{average waiting time in the queue} \\
P_0 = \text{if the system is idle} \\
P_b =\text{server in the system is busy} \\
p =\text{mean number of customers in service} \\
\lambda = \text{number of arrivals per time period} \\
\mu = \text{to be the mean (or average) number of customers served per time period} \\
$$

**Example:**

$$
\text{mean arrival rate}, \lambda = 10 customer/hour\\
\text{mean service rate}, \mu = \\

P_0 = 1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \\

\lambda = 4/min \\
\mu = 5/min \\

p = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
  = \frac{4}{5}
  = 0.8 \\

 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 \\

 W_q = \frac{\lambda}{\mu\left(\mu - \lambda \right)}

$$
